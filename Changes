        - always set a logging prefix, even if its just noise; this makes it
          easy to coordinate log lines
        - tell syslog to include pid; this was changed in v1.200002 due to a
          misunderstanding

        - new switch --timeout lets you set a timeout to kill jobs that take

        - when writing a lock file, put cronjob's pid in it

1.200003  2014-01-06 19:08:15 America/New_York
        - Process::Status is now used to interpret $?, making reports

1.200002  2013-12-07 08:52:23 America/New_York
        - do not log the pid to syslog; it should already be there
